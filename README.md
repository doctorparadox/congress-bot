Fieldbook codelet to retrieve info about currently-sitting members of Congress in Slack via slash command

## What you need

1. A [Fieldbook](https://fieldbook.com/) account
2. Access to your [Slack](http://www.slack.com) integrations admin

## How to use Fieldbook codelets

These little guys let you run script code in response to HTTP requests from inside your Fieldbook sheets, without having to go through a separate Heroku instance. Here's [more about codelets](https://medium.com/@fieldbook/announcing-fieldbook-codelets-77389d9eb59f#.fioqldhlb), and the [API docs](https://github.com/fieldbook/api-docs/blob/master/codelets.md) for more detail on how to use them. The [Node client docs](https://github.com/fieldbook/fieldbook-client) are helpful too.
